# rqbit - bittorrent client in Rust

**rqbit** is a bittorrent client written in Rust. Has HTTP API and Web UI, and can be used as a library.

Also has a desktop app built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) (on Windows and OSX).

## Usage quick start

### Optional - start the server

Assuming you are downloading to ~/Downloads.

    rqbit server start ~/Downloads

### Download torrents

Assuming you are downloading to ~/Downloads. If the server is already started, `-o ~/Downloads` can be omitted.

    rqbit download -o ~/Downloads 'magnet:?....' [https?://url/to/.torrent] [/path/to/local/file.torrent]

## Web UI

Access with http://localhost:3030/web/. It looks similar to Desktop app, see screenshot below.

## Desktop app

The desktop app is a [thin wrapper](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/blob/main/desktop/src-tauri/src/main.rs) on top of the Web UI frontend.

Download it in [Releases](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/releases).

## Performance

Anecdotally from a few reports, rqbit is faster than other clients they've tried, at least with their default settings.

Memory usage for the server is usually within a few tens of megabytes, which makes it great for e.g. RaspberryPI.

CPU is spent mostly on SHA1 checksumming.

## Installation

There are pre-built binaries in [Releases](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/releases).
If someone wants to put rqbit into e.g. homebrew, PRs welcome :)

[![](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/rqbit.svg)](https://repology.org/project/rqbit/versions)

If you have rust toolchain installed, this should work:

```
cargo install rqbit
```

## Build

Just a regular Rust binary build process.

    cargo build --release

## Useful options

### -v <log-level>

Increase verbosity. Possible values: trace, debug, info, warn, error.

### --list

Will print the contents of the torrent file or the magnet link.

### --overwrite

If you want to resume downloading a file that already exists, you'll need to add this option.

### --peer-connect-timeout=10s

This will increase the default peer connect timeout. The default one is 2 seconds, and it's sometimes not enough.

### -r / --filename-re

Use a regex here to select files by their names.

## Features and missing features

### Some supported features

- Sequential downloading (the default and only option)
- Resume downloading file(s) if they already exist on disk
- Selective downloading using a regular expression for filename
- DHT support. Allows magnet links to work, and makes more peers available.
- HTTP API
- Pausing / unpausing / deleting (with files or not) APIs
- Stateful server
- Web UI

### Bugs, missing features and other caveats

PRs are very welcome.

- Only supports BitTorrent V1 over TCP
- As this was created for personal needs, and for educational purposes, documentation, commit message quality etc. leave a lot to be desired.

## HTTP API

By default it listens on http://127.0.0.1:3030.

    curl -s 'http://127.0.0.1:3030/'

    {
        "apis": {
            "GET /": "list all available APIs",
            "GET /dht/stats": "DHT stats",
            "GET /dht/table": "DHT routing table",
            "GET /torrents": "List torrents (default torrent is 0)",
            "GET /torrents/{index}": "Torrent details",
            "GET /torrents/{index}/haves": "The bitfield of have pieces",
            "GET /torrents/{index}/peer_stats": "Per peer stats",
            "GET /torrents/{index}/stats/v1": "Torrent stats",
            "GET /web/": "Web UI",
            "POST /rust_log": "Set RUST_LOG to this post launch (for debugging)",
            "POST /torrents": "Add a torrent here. magnet: or http:// or a local file.",
            "POST /torrents/{index}/delete": "Forget about the torrent, remove the files",
            "POST /torrents/{index}/forget": "Forget about the torrent, keep the files",
            "POST /torrents/{index}/pause": "Pause torrent",
            "POST /torrents/{index}/start": "Resume torrent",
            "POST /torrents/{index}/update_only_files": "Change the selection of files to download. You need to POST json of the following form {"only_files": [0, 1, 2]}"
        },
        "server": "rqbit"
    }

### Add torrent through HTTP API

`curl -d 'magnet:?...' http://127.0.0.1:3030/torrents`

OR

`curl -d 'http://.../file.torrent' http://127.0.0.1:3030/torrents`

OR

`curl --data-binary @/tmp/xubuntu-23.04-minimal-amd64.iso.torrent http://127.0.0.1:3030/torrents`

Supported query parameters, all optional:

- overwrite=true|false
- only_files_regex - the regular expression string to match filenames
- output_folder - the folder to download to. If not specified, defaults to the one that rqbit server started with
- list_only=true|false - if you want to just list the files in the torrent instead of downloading

## Code organization

- crates/rqbit - main binary
- crates/librqbit - main library
- crates/librqbit-core - torrent utils
- crates/bencode - bencode serializing/deserializing
- crates/buffers - wrappers around binary buffers
- crates/clone_to_owned - a trait to make something owned
- crates/sha1w - wrappers around sha1 libraries
- crates/peer_binary_protocol - the protocol to talk to peers
- crates/dht - Distributed Hash Table implementation
- desktop - desktop app built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/)

## Motivation

First of all, I love Rust. The project was created purely for the fun of the process of writing code in Rust.

I was not satisfied with my regular bittorrent client, and was wondering how much work would it be to create a new one from scratch, and it got where it is, starting from bencode protocol implemenation, then peer protocol, etc, etc.
