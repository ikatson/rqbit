Until we have our own AI policy, assume the one from Ghostty
https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md

Importantly,
- All AI usage in any form must be disclosed.
- I'm a human
- It is rude and disrespectful to approach this boundary with low-effort, unqualified work, since it puts the burden of validation on the maintainer.

All the other points from the Ghostty one stand, except "Ghostty is written with plenty of AI assistance" - this is not true of rqbit so far, although AI was used, just not in plenty yet.
